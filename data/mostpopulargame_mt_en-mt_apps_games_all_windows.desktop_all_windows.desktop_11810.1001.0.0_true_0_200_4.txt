Adorable stickers can be collected in a box after scoring enough points.\r\n\r\n** List of math games in the app:\r\n• Hanging fruits\r\n• Number Fun\r\n• Shoot The Ball\r\n• Scratching Fun  \r\n• Bubbly Numbers\r\n• Puzzle Mania\r\n• Connect the dots\r\n• Hopping Frog  \r\n• Same to Same\r\n• Compare Twosome\r\n• Before and After\r\n• Juicy Grid\r\n• Sort it out","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFZQX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Colors (Preschool)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52546.9007199266294587.ed69da2f-cd93-454c-aba5-094dd45aa99d.6cf240be-41a0-438b-afdf-ad312769c987","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7467.9007199266294587.74ecb0d9-6c4a-4e7a-9843-9758eb9ae0ed.bc9bd36e-66b8-4b6c-bea2-d94a4c59f563","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1807.9007199266294587.968df4b3-b2fb-4104-b97b-45c00ce9e3c6.639e6744-4d6d-404d-a161-1b74e0e0d7ad","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47836.9007199266294587.7221283f-ef52-4ce7-b43d-7826c21cc04b.008eadc1-743d-401d-9ecf-b05bd32275c6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3F8CD1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Intellijoy.KidsColorsPreschool_aeskzhp7pykjg"],"ContentIds":["37fb7beb-062a-25b4-cda7-8409db6f7e3c","4e63578a-9fcf-2473-bad3-28eca331fd41","a3beb78f-2ef1-59c1-dda9-18bf47b00099","9f33326b-a5f5-44e3-20ca-2f2007ee6340"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Kids Colors lets toddlers and preschoolers learn to recognize colors and name them in ways that are really fun.\r\n\r\nThe game is from Intellijoy. We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDGZV6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dr. Panda's Supermarket","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6580.9007199266331985.6c91edb6-5a12-47a7-8742-f4e5acb5a9f1.6489923a-cb0b-4a80-97d4-13ba84466e88","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1165.9007199266331985.a4e55b64-1a42-43ca-af5d-73848dbd93d0.9c83c969-bc1d-487f-ad02-4f8361341eff","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21589.9007199266331985.5712250e-0842-4c0d-adbd-84201fc12ad6.594d9e93-2a83-4a44-b0ee-2cd4ed834339","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26826.9007199266331985.09a41dab-e9fe-4c60-8343-4b4230d4009e.71c69c8b-1e45-4cf9-ac08-c01c73f475fd","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9906.9007199266331985.07f30ee6-d26b-47de-a24b-ce49479f53f6.df0797f5-a906-4260-b2d9-79beb35bf242","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45825.9007199266331985.361935db-5463-459c-9504-93a0b7e95150.1cea414e-cfed-448f-8c17-7c13d6a2f6f0","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64147.9007199266331985.e81a006f-2f4c-4701-b516-f90947938f5b.1f823ee5-75c8-4587-9b2c-18b761f079e5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["TribePlayLtd.Dr.PandasSupermarket_p80trj3beywk8"],"ContentIds":["b3f41010-9be3-551a-7d6d-5f93f0b20135","8e77adc3-2e44-d83e-d201-b1f4e63f5995","e72a2847-bcab-4f20-339e-cf771a943591"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"★ Winner of the Children's Tech Review Editor's Choice Award! \r\n\r\n★ TheiMum.com \"Great app for toddlers and preschoolers which will help to practice fine motor, creative play, critical thinking skills.\"\r\n\r\n★ SmartAppsForKids.com \"The app in its entirety is solid and entertaining.\"\r\n\r\nIf your kid has ever wanted to run their own store, here’s their chance!

After all, they have so many beneficial vitamins. And each of them is unlike the other. Red, blue, and green, large and small, hard and soft. Some are sweet, others sour, and still more are salty. You might think that each fruit has its own personality. Merry strawberries, clumsy cabbages, and carefree oranges. I wonder what they would be like if they could live among us? We decided to indulge our imaginations and presented each fruit in its own characteristic way. The result turned out to be very interesting and fun!\r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color.

Learn on RC-AirSim first and make the maiden flight of your first r/c plane a successful one.\r\n\r\nRC-AirSim Lite features: \r\n\r\n· Fly a high wing Trainer airplane or an easy to fly Electric Parkflyer.\r\n· Realistic r/c model airplane flight aerodynamics based on NASA flight simulation technology. \r\n· Awesome Crashes! Planes break apart in a realistic physics-based manner. \r\n· Accurate Landings and Ground Handling. \r\n· 3 View Options - R/C, Following (Chase cam), and Onboard camera. Click camera icon to change. \r\n· 4 Channel Controls - aileron, elevator, rudder, throttle. \r\n· Optional On-screen Transmitter Sticks. \r\n· Fly with Mouse, Keyboard, Touch, or Xbox 360 Controller. \r\n· 3 control modes: Mode 2 (default), Mode 1, and 3 Channel. \r\n· Field objects to avoid and fly behind. (Not just a panoramic background photo environment.) \r\n· Doppler-correct sound. \r\n· Get flying quickly! No slow, tedious menus or multiple load screens. \r\n\r\nRC-AirSim Lite comes with these r/c model airplanes: \r\n\r\n· Back 40 Trainer \r\nClassic 4 channel high-wing trainer with plenty of dihedral for beginners. Powered by a .40 size gas engine. \r\n\r\n· Slowmowatt\r\nElectric park flyer. Flies very slow so there is plenty of time to react. Easiest to fly! Perfect for beginners using the 3 Channel control scheme. 4 channel control available.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: RC-AirSim is a realistic r/c model airplane flight simulator, NOT an arcade game. And like a real model airplane, it will take some practice to master the basics. Luckily, in RC-AirSim, plane crashes are free (and fun)! \r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments? Suggestions?

Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\n- After Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NXC6PBMWD76","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sea Battle 2 Battleship Warships","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20184.14432647834985095.37c21e3e-77f3-40cc-b65b-bd5a231f5451.c6e86034-d07d-4a13-9d50-168d7c9cc80b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10865.14432647834985095.37c21e3e-77f3-40cc-b65b-bd5a231f5451.fdfab553-de72-44b2-94f2-4ee1fec07fb2","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20184.14432647834985095.37c21e3e-77f3-40cc-b65b-bd5a231f5451.c6e86034-d07d-4a13-9d50-168d7c9cc80b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["48276FunGamesFree.SeaBattle2BattleshipWarships_nf94xajy52wwr"],"ContentIds":["a77da4bc-bf4c-4118-ca24-71bc657aa92d","815fbf78-b8ef-1810-d372-b7053db8249d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Sea Battle 2 Battleship Warships - Line up your submarine and launch a torpedo salvo.

As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in. We included in this game only winnable deals for all types of games: with one suit, with 2 suits and 4 suits. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly. Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The game starts by dealing six cards to each of the four players and placing one card face up in a discard pile. You must play a card of the same rank or suit over the card in the discard pile when your turn comes. In order to win you must have a very good strategy.\r\n\r\nWhat are you waiting for?

If he places a 2 the next player after him must take 4 cards and so on.\r\n✓ You can use the Jack to make the next player wait a turn. If the player before you places a Jack you can wait or place another Jack. \r\n✓ Following this turn the player who won't respond with a Jack waits a turn.\r\n✓ If you don't have a suitable card, you can draw one from the stockpile.\r\n✓ In order to wait a turn or take a card from the stockpile you need to tap the button next to your hand of cards. \r\n✓ If you don't have a suitable card after taking one from the stockpile, you must tap the \"Jump\" button.\r\n✓ You can use a 9 to reverse the order of the play. Normally the deal is done clockwise.\r\n✓ You can use an 8 to change the playing suit color. After you place an 8 a menu appears from which you can select the suit you want.\r\n✓ If other players specify a new suit using an 8, the type of the suit will appear briefly on top of the stockpile.\r\n✓ After a player plays all his cards, the round ends and points are awarded to this player.\r\n✓ The points are calculated by adding 10 points for each common card and 50 points for eights, Jacks, nines, and twos.\r\n✓ The first player to reach 300 points wins the game.\r\n✓ The game saves its state so you can exit the game and return from where you left.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

As you may know, most Solitaire games are not winnable, despite playing your best. We decided to fix that and provide you with the best game experience. We included in this game only winnable deals for both types of games: games in which you draw one card, and games in which you draw 3 cards. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly.\r\nDownload and play now! \r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ 100.000+ Solvable deals \r\n✓ Draw 1 or Draw 3 cards option\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Easy to use \r\n✓ High quality graphics\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ In this game you have to build up 4 stacks of cards of the same suit in each of the 4 foundation piles from the top of the screen. Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n✓ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n✓ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the game. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n✓ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDGZV4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dr. Panda's Daycare","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.43054.9007199266331987.5fdb6c86-e45c-4324-95b8-9c0d023fdf7c.8c502cfb-54ea-48be-832a-7da5713b76ff","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2806.9007199266331987.2540c806-2869-4adc-ba2f-9fa3d6ac3a1e.52f94ee5-a623-41eb-a1dc-0e249e2860fc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.56524.9007199266331987.59cfef78-ad6b-4fc2-ae92-5c7b95e9f527.fb2cfed1-dca1-44c7-9e3c-72f3bd64bf17","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11322.9007199266331987.a6420694-b872-4a3c-9c34-9853f0cb5b4b.0fb75cd2-094d-47b8-bf15-efe80e5c165d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.16769.9007199266331987.a32f72fe-3b25-4434-bff8-db112446eb2f.07be165d-03ac-4aef-93cc-c75f02057888","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.18895.9007199266331987.67ce3413-3adb-4740-95f6-2ab30d97fec7.a55f7496-6d01-452f-bd9c-7b1ff0edc2b2","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25626.9007199266331987.8fb317c3-a405-4cd6-bf1d-504c2fe90e78.69051158-51b1-4eb4-956d-f2ff0f27fc4c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TribePlayLtd.Dr.PandasDaycare_p80trj3beywk8"],"ContentIds":["fa089b16-06ef-3073-d03f-a40255972ab2","6907e4dd-1f77-fa99-00e9-421222aee4d8","de542cb3-17dc-f457-6200-9624a031ba26"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"* TOP PICK ON SMARTAPPSFORKIDS.COM! “A creative role-playing game full of cute critters and fun interactivity which is going to be used for hours and hours of creative play by your young ones”\r\n\r\n* WIRED “This charming preschooler game promotes role-playing and creativity for young children”\r\n\r\n* GIGGLEAPPS “Dr. Panda’s Daycare is a delightful role-playing app for toddlers and those in preschool”\r\n\r\nImagine and play in Dr. Panda’s Daycare!

A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei.

You are automatically moved through a wonderfully designed little\r\nfantasy village that has 26 houses. Each house has a letter on the door and\r\nlots of little special effects floating around it. Just tap the door and the letter\r\nis pronounced in English.\r\n\r\nThen the game enters picture coloring mode where you can use fill and draw\r\ntools and have 16 colors to choose from. Each picture is related to an English\r\nword that starts with the letter on the door. The English word is also shown\r\nin outline form so each letter of the word can also be filled in and colored as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nOnce you are done coloring a picture you can return to the village where it\r\nwill congratulate you with one of several happy phrases and then you are\r\nautomatically moved through the village to the next house. When you get all\r\nthe way to the end and finish house \"Z\" it goes back to house \"A\" so you can\r\nstart again.\r\n\r\nThe app also saves your location so you start at the house where you left off.\r\nYou can always reset to house \"A\" from the pause menu where you can\r\nindividually turn the sounds and music on and off as well.\r\n\r\nThis app was designed in a way that makes young children to see the\r\nwonderful village so they will want to color more. At the same time it teaches\r\nEnglish letter pronunciation and basic English words. All of this happens in\r\nsuch a fun way that your young children will not even notice they are\r\nlearning at the same time!\r\n\r\nThe is a one of a kind preschool/kindergarten app that combines a \"3d\"\r\nvirtual world with normal coloring in a way we believe has never been done\r\nbefore. At the same time, navigation from house to house is automatic so\r\nyour child cannot get lost trying to wonder around and the interface is easy\r\nand intuitive to use.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRB0Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Gomoku Online","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28503.9007199266546378.8ac70391-2c93-4c6c-81ed-f8de4ab74cb3.0052524b-bd56-4fcf-896e-6d605b434ff1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12394.9007199266546378.815092f8-52df-49b9-8795-a25dcec46ace.f3e3530b-901b-4875-9396-1689fd8e4f79","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44608.9007199266546378.a4aade80-8b12-4a67-9e22-f5625965ddef.6c7140d7-5c9a-46c6-a1c2-9cd7272daf0f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31586.9007199266546378.d33f21ad-8b50-4318-8151-4548e2c0eb07.af4b3a30-1d20-4aa6-9397-7bd589ec106e","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44169.9007199266546378.4942994e-ba80-4d65-b070-c10802c2a0e6.0ae07174-6e00-4aef-bc87-e582faca4818","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63918.9007199266546378.b2c78469-0a41-41e8-97c8-2cd667da03cd.d99f9f86-65de-4c1e-966a-b023e3c138da","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["19363BlueskyStudio.GomokuOnline_ad90gx91p0mxj"],"ContentIds":["8d3b5c0b-8ab7-4fb0-4aa0-8901af91ce2c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play Gomoku online with players all over the world, or play offline with machine AI. Full board view, easy way to place stones, and strong AI.\r\n\r\nGomoku is an abstract strategy board game and is also called Five in a Row. It is played with black and white stones on a 15x15 intersections board. Stones can not be moved or removed from the board once placed. Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\r\n\r\nThe Gomoku Pro rule set some restrictions on the first few moves to reduce the advantage Black has by going first:\r\n1. Black's very first move must be in the center of the game board.\r\n2. White's first move can be anywhere.\r\n3. Black's second move must be outside the five-by-five area in the center of the game board.\r\n4. White's second move, and all moves after that, can be anywhere.\r\n5. Win by placing exactly five stones in a row, six or more in a row does not win.\r\nWhen play offline, you may choose whether use Gomoku pro rule or not. But when play online the rule is mandatory. \r\nTo place stone on board, just tap rough position on board, and tap again on the exact destination of amplified board.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRL1J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Japan Food Adventure - Tokyo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15804.9007199266555577.c763fa45-b590-4417-8005-c1a53f19fcc5.7412a755-06c2-459e-ae2e-6b7ec797d544","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["49260AfzainizamZahari.JapanFoodAdventure-Tokyo_rnbdrcgmgm87p"],"ContentIds":["5e18acd9-ef97-701a-06bd-ae3e317ea8b1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Prepare, cook and serve lots of delectable Japanese dishes and snacks in this exciting and fast-paced time-management game!

The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win. Everyone loves the timeless game-play of Onopoly. \r\n\r\nTry to win the onopoly game by buying all the property and collecting as much money as possible. \r\nWill you be able to defeat your opponents? \r\n\r\nDownload Onopoly for free!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Onopoly Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Create Private Room and Invite Friends and Family\r\n✔ True multiplayer where you can play with real people online in online multiplayer mode.\r\n✔ Adaptable intelligence with smart AI when playing against computer\r\n✔ Play with players across the world\r\n✔ 2, 3,4,5 or 6 Player Mode \r\n✔ Play with Local Multiplayer\r\n \r\nPlease don't forget to Rate and Review Onopoly! \r\n\r\nYour Reviews Matter!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1JXVV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Police Car Chase Smash - Traffic Violation Control","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58139.13510798885993121.f1e1bee0-2ed0-4730-87db-6948dbbc0af2.b3b28846-62ad-43cd-9fec-155a740b2368","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28545.13510798885993121.a6e5c587-0e68-4f7d-b739-fe1dce025405.1f33b135-eadd-4357-a73d-0e5a227b097c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59345.13510798885993121.c08fc3bc-f2bd-4643-9ba5-fea056dc3c9e.01c5a29d-f75b-493d-8df8-b1daf8249a35","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["14859AppStreamStudios.PoliceCarChaseSmash-TrafficV_ykgtwtztg31z8"],"ContentIds":["e4182e15-37f7-04af-7468-d0d7fee487ff","a3487a73-3f03-421b-dbb8-cce8e7ffff08"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Start your cop duty with police car as your transport to chase & smash criminal cars.\r\n\r\nProve yourself as the brave police officer to control crime and chase down criminals.
