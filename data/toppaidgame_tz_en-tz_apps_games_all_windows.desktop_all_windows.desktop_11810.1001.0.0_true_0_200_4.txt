A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDJ2S5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Star Shipping Inc.","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35799.9007199266483866.13f05447-4c2f-4bec-b178-7171b6726050.d2bb8dea-1418-4eee-9043-a06f4f033eff","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56477.9007199266483866.6bfd36b5-24ae-48b1-9351-289eac63e0aa.a7c244bd-bc1d-40ba-ae3a-72d8c68181f8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["6D0669D6.31597E28EE017_qvtjws96jvq8y"],"ContentIds":["df335699-d0d3-d622-a429-5afb91c00a8d","f96c04f9-ee3e-54ac-f82b-c01fb8469ec1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel through space and get rich with Star Shipping Inc.

It is based on the popular Austrian Tarock - also known as \"Königsrufen (King Calling)\".\r\n\r\nThe complete deck contains 54 cards, 32 color suit cards and 22 tarock cards. The color suits are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The tarock cards are labeled by roman numerals from I, II, III, ... to XXII and function in the game as a permanent suit of trumps. The playing order is counter-clockwise. The game starts with an auction process: The player with the highest bidding becomes the game declarer. There are positive games and negative games: In a positive game, the declarer must achieve a minimum number of points to win. In a negative game, the declarer must achieve the announced number of tricks (0 to 2) exactly. Basically, in all games, players have to follow suit. In negative games additionally, each player must overtrump if possible. Because there are special games for the forehand player, it never happens that all players pass and no game comes out. See Game Rules for the details.\r\n\r\nThe current version provides five playing modes:\r\n•Offline mode\r\n In this mode, the user controls at least one player. All other players will be controlled by the simulator \"Tarobot\". The simulator by the way sees only those cards the human player would also see. But you, too, can let the \"Tarobot\" support you in playing. If you select the appropriate setting, it marks the action on the user interface that it would perform in your place.\r\n•Learning mode\r\n In the learning mode you can question any action that the \"Tarobot\" simulator proposes for you. He will then tell you the reasons why he thinks the action makes sense. Of course, the Tarobot is not a person who takes into account the psychology of other players. He is a pure numeric, who expresses everything in numbers to evaluate them with his algorithms. But he knows all the rules and can give the beginner important hints when practicing the game.\r\n•Quiz mode\r\n This mode is a variant of the offline mode. In addition to the fun of playing, you can train your memory and thus your playing skills improve. Randomly selected questions about the current card playing state are presented to you during the game. After you have selected the supposedly correct answer, the solution will be presented to you immediately. Depending on the question you will get different number of points for the correct or also for an almost correct solution. In the quiz statistics you can read the development of your success in a calendar. If you have reached a minimum number of points and a minimum success rate, you will also receive symbolic awards such as flower pot, medal, and cup.\r\n•Online mode\r\n In this mode, up to 4 owners of a full license can play together online. If less then 4 users are participating in an online session, the remaining players are simulated. In parallel to the playing session, a Skype audio conference should be held, enabling the same conversation between the players as in a real card playing group. Before starting the first session, one of the online users must create a online user group. This user becomes the group administrator, responsible for maintaining the group. The lifespan of the group is limited to 90 days initially. By purchasing an add-on, the lifespan can be extended by 365 days per purchase. Online games are subject to charge. The full license already includes 25 payed online games. By purchasing an add-on, the contingent of payed online games can be increased by 100 or 500 games per purchase respectively.\r\n•Autonomous mode\r\n In this mode, the application plays completely independently without user participation. Of course, this is primarily intended for testing. But it can also be fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe user interface shows a gaming table in the middle where the players can place their cards. On the four sides of the table, the four players are located showing the hand cards, the tricks pile and other details. Only the hand cards of the user-controlled players are shown face-up. All other hands are showing the cards facedown. You - the current Windows user, must control at least one player.\r\n\r\nIn an offline session, you can undo and redo all actions of the game. You may also utilize assistance from \"Tarobot\" while playing. For replaying games, you can allocate a game archive. The archived games can be reopened and automatically replayed to any situation of interest. Experts may even build their very own games based on an existing game by using the edit mode. In this mode, cards can be exchanged freely between the players and between players and the Talon.\r\n\r\nIn an online session, you can play Tarock with your friends wherever they may be. Most of the manipulation and assistance functions of the offline mode are disabled in this case. Even though, the group administrator can enable and disable some them, such as \"undo\", with mutual consent even during a session.\r\n\r\nMultiple settings options allow you to change game parameters and appearance. You may select another color theme or another card face or card back design for example. You even may insert your favorite photo in one of the card backs containing a special photo frame. You can also activate speech output. Then, for example, you will hear the announcements of the simulated players and you do not have to pay so much attention to the screen display.\r\n\r\nIn the comprehensive online-help, you can find a detailed description of the game rules and of the user interface. It also describes how to perform each of the playing tasks.\r\n\r\nKubiTarock is designed for the Universal Windows Platform. You can install and use the app on all devices powered by Windows 10. The user interface adapts itself to the current device capabilities.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMHT1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jane's Zoo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27496.9007199266452308.06e9dae3-6857-408f-ad3e-597423f8bb50.d59a6565-6c8e-4adb-8ada-b675c493d955","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65484.9007199266452308.0d401cee-68ec-46b6-9396-78ef9d3831a1.71560c7d-9744-40e3-8d51-ffd5f8309eb7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$3.49","Price":3.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["780F5C7B.JanesZoo_0gmyx1dmsk3dw"],"ContentIds":["2180952f-8e65-9c2a-26e6-d483646f8cf4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Feel the spirit of freedom and plunge yourself into the world of wild nature!

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and was the direct cause of the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \r\n\r\nMagic Age 1053\r\nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun, the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back. \r\nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire. \r\n\r\nPetun?little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map.

Gin Rummy has two types of melds: Sets of 3 or 4 cards sharing the same rank, and runs of 3 or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. Deadwood cards are those not in any melds. Aces are considered low, they can form a set with another aces but only the low end of runs. A Gin Rummy player can form any combination of melds within their hand, whether it contains all the sets, all runs, or both. A hand can contain three or fewer melds to knock or form legal Gin. \r\n\r\nDeveloped specifically for the the Phone and Tablet with an intuitive interface, Gin Rummy will be a pleasure to play and pass time anywhere, anytime.

This girl likes to explore things, likes to see something new and enjoys adventures so much. At this moment she is in Egypt. Actually she is in the south part of Egypt, near the city known as Luxor, in the area Abul Nagaa. She has come there because she believes that the ancient tombs in this place are not sufficiently explored. She thinks that the tombs are actually forgotten and someone has to see what is hiding there.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit to the tombs in Luxor, Nicole realizes that he was right in her assumptions because very soon she starts discovering new things. Namely, she starts finding a lot of valuable objects including eight mummies undiscovered until now. This seems like a really important discovery but the findings don't stop here. Additionally Nicole discovers small statues that weren't found before in Egypt or on any other place around the world.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating.

Notes: - MineChat does not work with servers that require client modification such as Tekkit. - MineChat will work over 3G/4G, but eats up a good bit of data and can run slow depending on your connection. So it is recommended you are on WI-fi when in using MineChat. - MineChat does not support Forge Modloader servers. - MineChat sends a spawn command automatically upon connection to help prevent your character from getting killed while using the app. However, not all servers support the spawn command or have delay before teleporting you which leaves your character vulnerable during that time period. Be sure you are aware how your server handles spawning. Security: MineChat does not send any credentials or information of any kind to any third party servers. The only information transmitted is directly to Minecraft servers. It uses the exact same login method as the Minecraft game uses.

Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic. \r\n\r\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\r\n \r\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced.

There are three different variations of the game, BubbleWalk, PokerWalk and BingoWalk. You move along the road by walking in place, like a leisurely march. At the same time, you can do some playing tasks with either your right or left hand. In BubbleWalk you pop some bubbles as you walk along the road. Count how many bubbles you can pop. In PokerWalk, you are presented with ten cards along the road, you can pick five of them, you cannot change or return a card so try to choose wisely to get a good poker hand at the end of the road. If you have something on your hand, you can save the result, so if you want, you can try to collect different types of hands. In BingoWalk you control a magic beam with your hand. Find the five Bingo objects along your way, and aim your beam at the objects to collect them. But be careful, the objects will start to drift upwards as soon as you point your beam at them. If you get Bingo, you can save your time result.\r\n\r\nTYPE OF GAME\r\nThe Country Ramble Games are intended both as recreation and as a way to get exercise in a simple way. Note that these are not extreme action games. Country Ramble Games can be played by people with impaired mobility as well as people who want a little more than an ordinary walk, just level the step height button. The step height button determines how high you need to lift your feet or knees to get around. You can change the step height level to your preference. At the lowest setting it's easy to get around, this may be a good setting for elderly or people with some kind of mobility impairment. There are no time limits, if you feel like it, you can stop and rest outside the mediaeval chapel and listen to some hymns, you can turn down the game music volume and just listen to the birds, or why not pump up the step height level and turn the music volume up and get a really good exercise. Of course, you don't actually need to \"play\" anything if you don't want to, just walk and relax.\r\n\r\nWHO CAN PLAY\r\nThis game can be played by anyone who wants to take a leisurely walk or stroll in the countryside, one can even \"walk\" sitting down which makes it useful for elderly or for people with some form of mobility impairment. For those who want a more intense and difficult march, increasing the Step Height level will for sure make the pulse go up.\r\nThe games are simple in their design and will suit people also with less experience in computer gaming. The games are intentionally made to be cognitive non-demanding to suit people in need for relaxed activities. They may be a good choice for people with cognitive difficulties, such as in stress related fatigue syndrome where attention can be easily overwhelmed by stimuli, or for people with brain fatigue or minor dysfunctions caused by stroke. There are no \"bells and whistles\" in the games, at least very little, the scenes takes place in nature in a calm environment and the music consists of a mix of old folktunes (walking tunes), classical pieces with a somewhat modern arrangement. (Generally, \"Country Ramble Games\" were designed to be less stressful and less physically demanding than some common motion games.) The games has been developed with the support of psychological expertise. \r\nAs results can be saved and viewed in plotted graphs or in high score tables, the games could also be useful in a clinical context, such as in stroke rehabilitation and physiotherapy, since you can easily view progress in training. And the games can hopefully be a fun way of training a weak leg or arm. In such cases, discuss game playing with your medical advisor. For people suffering from problems with balance or mobility impairment such as weakness in legs, one can play sitting down.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need an adapter. After installation of Kinect you should have the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 installed in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Country Ramble Games.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\nTo make sure the game runs well on your system, you can download the free demo version before buying the full game. Download free demo (Country Ramble DEMO) at Windows Store or get more info at http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed, see above under \"Technical stuff\"\r\n•\tStart the game by pressing the Country Ramble Games icon. \r\n•\tFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants and press one of the correspondent buttons underneath to play with either right or left hand. \r\n•\tStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, the blue screen layer will disappear.\r\n•\tWalk in place, that is, march on the spot, lifting your feet and knees a little. \r\n•\tMove either your right or left hand (depending on which hand you've chosen) to pop bubbles, pick cards or point beam at bingo items. \r\n•\tWhen you're done, you will be taken to the Orientation Board. From the Orientation Board Menu, you can either restart or choose one of the two other games. You choose either by putting your hand in one of the boxes or use the mouse to click.\r\n•\tIf you choose to go back to the Main Menu start screen, you can click on Result to view your result under any of the five player icons. (If you have saved any result.)\r\n\r\nPlaying the game variations:\r\n•\tBubbleWalk: As you walk, there will be bubbles appearing in front of you, sometimes shooting up way ahead of you, to reach them you will have keep a steady pace. Don't worry if you can't, as long as you walk and don't stand still, bubbles will keep appearing along the road. Try to pop the bubbles by reaching out at them with your hand.\r\n•\tPokerWalk: Ten cards will be placed along the road. try to get a poker hand by choosing wisely. When you're in reach to pick a card, a little sound can be heard. To pick a card, hold up your hand, a red lightbulb will show up around the card, keep holding your hand up for about 3 sec, and the card will show up in the panel at the bottom of the screen. Once you picked a card you cannot change it. If you don't want a card, just pass it. When you've picked five cards, you cannot pick any more card. The type of hands you can get (in order of value) is; one pair, two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, and royal flush. If you get some of those hands and your cards are high you can also get bonus points added to the total sum. Both the type of hand and the total sum will be recorded if you choose to save your results.\r\n•\tBingoWalk: Five objects will show up on the panel at the bottom of the screen. As you walk along the road, try to spot those items (sometimes they are easy to see, sometimes not so easy). When you find them, point your magic beam towards them and they will start to float upwards. To catch the objects, hold your beam so it turns red, try to follow the object with your hand so the beam keeps being red for about 3 sec.  If you catch it, it will be checked in your panel. Tip; try to get close to the objects, at long distances or far to the sides, it can be hard to point and keep the beam steady enough. If you miss an object, you will get a second chance at the end.\r\n\r\nMORE INFO:\r\nDownload free Demo version at: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\nSee Video Tutorial on

Your goal is to match pairs of hanafuda cards to score points by collecting specific card pairs (called yaku). Only 1 yaku is necessary to win the round, but only by risking your win and calling \"koi koi\", you can earn even more yakus and get bonus score multipliers. \r\n\r\nPlay against the computer in a quick game, or play through the campaign mode and unlock postcards from famous landmarks of Japan. Battle each region's guide to unlock 5 regional postcards.\r\n\r\n** Beginner Friendly Games with adjustable difficulty\r\nStart the game on the easiest mode and learn the ropes. Play through our tutorial level that explains the game mechanics and scoring system. During the gameplay, you can consult a visual list of cards, as well as all the available yakus.

The dealer deals five cards face down, and one at a time to each player in a clockwise direction. The rest of the cards are stacked and kept in the center as the draw pile. The topmost card is placed face up to initiate the discard pile, next to the draw pile. \r\n\r\nPlay with your friends, against the computer, against millions of Tonk players around the world.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play.\r\n\r\nIt is an enjoyable card game that is both fast-paced and strategic.\r\n\r\nPlay this classic card game with your friends or against real players from anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nYou might have played many card games but there is nothing like Tonk.\r\n\r\nGive our game a try.
